	<h1>Analytics Service Wrapper</h1>
  <p>A promise-based Analytics Service wrapper for Roblox.</p>
</div>


### Features:

- **Queuing System:** Ensures all analytics events are processed without throttling (FIFO-basis).
- **Promise-Based API:** Handles unexpected errors during execution, logging problems while maintaining overall service functionality.
- **Type Safe-Guarding**: Protects against invalid or malformed inputs, such as empty lists or incorrect data types, with strict validation mechanisms.

   ```
3. Run the Wally install command to download and integrate the package:
    ```bash
    wally install
    ```
4. The package will be placed in your Packages folder. Use the following code snippet to require it in your project:
    ```lua
    local AnalyticsServiceWrapper = require(path-to-package)
    ```

### Methods:

This wrapper includes all methods provided by the default Analytics Service, with the exception of ProgressionEvents. For detailed information on the available parameters, visit the official [Analytics Service Documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/AnalyticsService#summary).

- **`LogCustomEvent(player, eventName, value?, customFields?)`**
  - Logs a custom event with optional value and custom fields.
- **`LogEconomyEvent(player, flowType, currencyType, amount, endingBalance, transactionType, itemSKU?, customFields?)`**
  - Logs an economic event, such as purchases or earnings.
- **`LogFunnelStep(player, funnelName, funnelSessionId?, stepNumber, stepName?, customFields?)`**
  - Logs a step in the funnel. If no funnelSessionId is provided, then a GUID will be generated.
- **`LogOnboardingFunnelStep(player, stepNumber, stepName?, customFields?)`**
  - Logs a step in the onboarding funnel.
- **`AnalyticsWrapper:ForValues(callback, playerList)`**
  - Iterates through a list of players, executing a callback function for each. The callback must return a promise. Promise rejection here will not throw a rejection to the overall operation.

### Example Usage:

#### 1. Log a Funnel Step

```lua
AnalyticsWrapper:LogFunnelStep(player, "LevelProgression", 2, "LevelStart")
    :andThen(function()
        print("Funnel step logged successfully.")
    end)
    :catch(function(errMessage)
        warn("Error logging funnel step: " .. tostring(errMessage))
    end)
```

#### 2. Log Events for Multiple Players

```lua
AnalyticsWrapper:ForValues(function(player: Player)
        return AnalyticsWrapper:LogFunnelStep(player, "RoundProgression", 1, "Lobby")
    end, Players:GetPlayers())
    :catch(function(errMessage)
        warn("Unable to log funnel step: " .. tostring(errMessage))
    end)
```

### FAQ:
1. **How are actions processed from the queue?**
   
   A background loop runs continuously ensuring that For each player and event type:
   - The system checks if the cooldown for the event type has expired.
   - If the cooldown has expired, the first action in the queue is removed using table.remove.
   - The action is executed, and any success or failure is handled through the `resolve` or `reject` callbacks.
---
2. **How does rate-limiting work in the queue?**
   
    It is static, meaning each event type has a cooldown (e.g., CustomEvent = 0.5 seconds). The LastExecutionTime table tracks when the last action for a specific event type was executed for a player. If the cooldown hasnâ€™t expired, the action waits in the queue.
---
3. **Does the queue maintain order and precedence for step-based events?**
    
    Yes, the queue ensures correct step order for `FunnelStep` and `OnboardingFunnelStep` events:
    - It checks the `stepNumber` against the highest logged step.
    - If the step is out of order or has already been processed in the past, the queue skips it in favor of that highest step.
